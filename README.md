# m0rehud sharp

Full #base code m0rehud with TF2 files update tool. 

The only noticeable changes from the main version are a built in minmode version which can be activated with *cl_hud_minmode 1* and a streamer mode which can be enabled by removing the final underscore from the _streamermode_ folder.

*Thats a side project from the normal m0rehud since I want to keep the main version more user friendly. I'm just storing this here for now.*
